# Simple-Software-Protection-Suite .NET 6 (Windows Only)

##UPDATED TO NET 6 WINFORMS AND LIBRARY

Simple attempt to generate a class to create protection keys for software.   
One of my customers want a not so complicated method to try to get a minimum of security for his propietary software.  
This is that project.</br>  
Nothing unbeteable, nothing complicated just a little layer of protection for your software.  

The class can generate a key that you can store and check on your keys server or authentication service.  

Just this! returns **TRUE** or **FALSE**.  
 
There are plenty of paid protection suites a lot more robust and strong.  
As an free software and fully Opensource beleiver I made the library available to anyone that needs this little tool.
